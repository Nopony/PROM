Command mode automatically converts when data is available.

APR = Address Pointer Register
CRR = Conversion Result Register

It is enabled by setting the APR to 0b00010000.

The first byte of every write is automatically written to the APR.

Setting the 4 LSBs of APR to 0000 also means the next read will access the CRR.
